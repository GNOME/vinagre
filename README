Enabling scaling
================

  - In order to enable scaling in Vinagre, gtk-vnc widget must have been
  compiled with this feature enabled.
    Simply build gtk-vnc with the flag '--with-gtkglext=yes', in the
    configure stage.
    Notice that this version of Vinagre (2.24.x) requires gtk-vnc 0.3.7. Newer
  gtk-vnc versions don't use GtkGL for scaling anymore and thus break Vinagre
  scaling.

Bookmarks
=========

  - In Vinagre 2.23.3 we have moved the bookmarks file location from ~/.gnome2
  to ~/.local/share/vinagre, which is the recommended place for data files.
  The change should be transparent, i.e., we automatically copy the old file
  to the new place if we detect that new file does not exist yet.
